I\u00b4d like to share my experience as a joiner in new projects who have to deal with this complexity for the beginning.\n\nIf you only use git to commit your changes and allow it to integrate, you\u00b4re probably losing the opportunity to take advantage of all the things that you can do with git. When I used to teach git to young developers I say git is more than six commands, because it's about how you and your team are building software. So using git you\u00b4re able to discover all the collaborative dynamics in your current project.\n\nDuring this talk I\u2019ll share how you can use git as the magnifier to learn not just about code, to learn about how your team is collaborating together, how to reconstruct parts of your project, understand how your team is building features, how git could gives you the answer to many questions for your team, I\u2019ll share how it\u2019s a powerful tool for new joiners, and how git could become you to a better team player.\n\nAbout Git Merge:\nGit Merge is dedicated to amplifying new voices in the Git community and showcasing the most thought-provoking projects from developers, maintainers, and teams around the world.

Enable Dependabot version updates by committing a dependabot.yml configuration file to your repository. \n\nAfter you've enabled version updates, you can customize how Dependabot maintains your dependencies by adding further options to the dependabot.yml file. For example, you could:\n\n1. Specify which day of the week to open pull requests for version updates: schedule.day.\n2. Set reviewers, assignees, and labels for each package manager: reviewers, assignees, and labels.\n3. Define a versioning strategy for changes to each manifest file: versioning-strategy.\n4. Change the maximum number of open pull requests for version updates from the default of 5: open-pull-requests-limit.\n5.

And it\u2019s a time to reflect collectively that the challenges faced aren\u2019t all technical, and the burden on maintainers can come with a lack of boundaries, vacations, or emotional support. Whether you\u2019re celebrating contributions to open source, or reflecting on the particular pains of this line of labor, this is a month to come together.\n\nHosted by GitHub\u2019s own Martins Ewere and Community co-host and GitHub Star Ruth Ikegah.\n\nEvent Program:\n- GitHub News with Martins and Ruth \ud83d\udcfa\n\n- Speaker: Marlene Mhangami\nhttps://twitter.com/marlene_zw\n\nTopic: Maintaining an Open Source Project\nMarlene is a Zimbabwean software engineer, explorer, and speaker based in the city of Harare.

That's why productivity is such an important issue. And that's where project planning comes in.\n\nProject planning is a critical tool for organizations of all sizes. It can help you ship products faster, increase efficiency, and improve communication among team members. In this demo, Senior Software Engineer Jed Verity will show you how to use GitHub Projects to boost productivity in your organization. You'll learn how to create and manage projects, set deadlines, and track progress. You'll also learn how to use project planning to resolve conflicts and make better decisions about priorities. By the end of this talk, you'll have a better understanding of how project planning with GitHub Projects can help your organization succeed.\n\nAbout our Speaker:\n\nHaving been both a manager and engineer at GitHub, not to mention a lifelong productivity nerd, Jed is deeply interested in tools and practices that help teams and individuals do their best work. Before joining GitHub, he was a Senior Manager of Systems Architecture at Maxar Technologies, but across a career that spans multiple decades he has been a founder, CTO, and, maybe the best title of all, \"Fulfillment Manager\" at Canto Software, Inc.\n\nJed also speaks 5 languages and holds a PhD in Tibetan Buddhism, but that can be hard to explain in the context of a career in technology, so he usually includes those facts in bios just to sound smart and interesting.\n\nJed lives in Charlottesville, VA with his family."}, {"url": "f_GTfqfh218", "label": "Security at the Speed of GitHub", "imagen": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f_GTfqfh218/mqdefault.jpg", "playlistId": ["PL0lo9MOBetEGtBCe9BsLCRXbS9iyxjaMa"], "position": 1, "type": "video", "id": "UEwwbG85TU9CZXRFR3RCQ2U5QnNMQ1JYYlM5aXl4amFNYS5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2", "publishedAt": "2022-06-29", "description": "#30minutestomerge\n\nBy driving greater risk reduction and scale without impeding velocity, GitHub Advanced Security allows teams to deploy faster and safer.

You can learn about many of the things we\u2019re planning over the coming year by browsing issues located on the project board within the repository. Each roadmap item talks about what we\u2019re planning, why it\u2019s important, and a bit about how we expect it to work. Interested in a particular product area or beta previews? You can filter issues using one or more labels to find just what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\nThis is the first time ever we've released a public roadmap.

Such was the case for Intuit in early 2018 when the company set out on its innersource journey. At the time, its engineering teams were using different structures for their repositories, different best-practices for documentation, and different workflows for code reviews. Today, the company is well on its way to company-wide adoption of innersource, with more than half of its repositories open for contribution, and a goal to open them all. In this talk, Intuit will share a model that enterprise companies can use to teach global engineering teams to work as an innersource community.

You're probably used to seeing these kinds of visuals accompanying news stories, or as part of tools that you use at work, or to keep track of personal information like your finances or health. It's easy to focus on the massive scale of a dataset or the dramatic quality of spectacular design, but data visualization as a process begins much more simply by asking questions, observing, and thinking critically.

Through code scanning, it analyzes your pull requests and flags up security issues as early as possible. But who creates these CodeQL queries and how do they know what to look for? For the last two years, a community of security researchers have been contributing to CodeQL queries that formalize their security knowledge. Queries written by independent researchers, enterprise security teams, and everyone in between now help protect all CodeQL users from security vulnerabilities. In this session you'll find out more about this community, the bounty programs, and the tools they use to help you secure your code.

It\u2019s pretty exciting: I will sketch the context and describe our progress.\n\nBut I will focus on one particularly exciting development: Project Quantum. So-called \u201cdiagnostic questions\u201d are multiple choice questions that promote learning (rather than measurement). But it\u2019s hard to know which ones work well, and which don\u2019t. In partnership with an ed-tech startup (Eedi) we now have hundreds of millions of data points and are beginning to apply both statistics (Rasch analysis) and machine learning (variational autoencoders) to distilling insights from this data.\n\nAbout Simon Peyton-Jones\nI fell in love with functional programming when I was 20, and I am still in love today. I helped design Haskell, and I spend a lot of time on GHC, Haskell's most widely-used compiler (including inside GitHub).\n\nI got involved in education because I was dissatisfied with the computing education my children experienced.

I urged lazy evaluation on John Backus (but failed to persuade him). I was a co-designer of Haskell. I moved to Sweden, home of the Lazy ML compiler, in the nineties, and at the turn of the millennium I co-invented property-based testing.

In his words: \"I believe that my journey has been unique and interesting enough to share with others and provide insight into the possibilities of a career in Technology as an undocumented, prior to DACA, and DACAmented individual, post DACA.\n I've gone through an interesting journey to end up where I am as a Software Engineer. I started as a Mechanical Engineering major in college back in 2013. I had a couple of internships in college with Red Ventures in their IT Department and my Junior year in college changed my major to Mathematics with a Computer Engineering minor. \n\n I also held a part-time job at Red Ventures my Senior year as an Inside Sales Professional. Upon graduating in 2017 from UNC @ Charlotte I got a job in Red Ventures IT Department as a Desktop Support Technician with the goal of taking the Red Ventures Internal Tech Academy a year later to transition into Software Engineering. I completed that transition in the Fall of 2018 and have been loving my job ever since. \n\n I have recently been doing my best to apply the technical skills I've learned as a digital activist for our Latinx community. My focus is to help move the needle forward with all social equity issues but primarily the immigration issue the US is going through. As an undocumented/DACAmented individual this is one of the most important issues for me to fight for.\""}, {"url": "YYYYHLwuL7g", "label": "Daniel Bustamante Ospina - Arquitectura de microservicios reactivos con Reactive Commons", "imagen": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYYYHLwuL7g/mqdefault.jpg", "playlistId": ["PL0lo9MOBetEFX6kZgVjjX7Pg8n-kDK962"], "position": 4, "type": "video", "id": "UEwwbG85TU9CZXRFRlg2a1pnVmpqWDdQZzhuLWtESzk2Mi4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01", "description": "Obtener los beneficios de los sistemas no bloqueantes y la programaci\u00f3n reactiva, mediante el modelo de programaci\u00f3n funcional, inmutabilidad y la orientaci\u00f3n a mensajes en sistemas distribuidos; usandoReactive Commons un proyecto open-source apalancado desde Bancolombia c\u00f3mo un esfuerzo por integrar la programaci\u00f3n reactiva (Reactive Streams y Project Reactor) y un modelado del dominio que toma elementos de DDD y patrones c\u00f3mo Event Notification, Pub/Sub, Mensajer\u00eda directa (Comandos), para poder crear soluciones altamente escalables, resilientes y extensibles."}, {"url": "xrln0gyKLjg", "label": "Marcos B\u00e9rgamo - Como a comunidade me fez crescer profissionalmente", "imagen": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xrln0gyKLjg/mqdefault.jpg", "playlistId": ["PL0lo9MOBetEFX6kZgVjjX7Pg8n-kDK962"], "position": 5, "type": "video", "id": "UEwwbG85TU9CZXRFRlg2a1pnVmpqWDdQZzhuLWtESzk2Mi4xMkVGQjNCMUM1N0RFNEUx", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01", "description": "\"Nesta palestra, a ideia \u00e9 demonstrar como a intera\u00e7\u00e3o com as comunidades e o open source pode contribuir drasticamente no seu crescimento profissional.\n Al\u00e9m do networking, gostaria de falar sobre as experi\u00eancias \u00fanicas de se participar de uma comunidade de software (user group) saud\u00e1vel pode contribuir para sua carreira. \n Darei algumas dicas e exemplos de atitudes que podem ajudar profissionais em est\u00e1gios iniciais e se desenvolver rapidamente e tamb\u00e9m para profissionais mais experientes a como se engajar mais e se tornar vis\u00edvel e refer\u00eancia em sua \u00e1rea.\""}, {"url": "3mBLENeXZH8", "label": "Alfredo Garay - Los 4 poderes del coaching", "imagen": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3mBLENeXZH8/mqdefault.jpg", "playlistId": ["PL0lo9MOBetEFX6kZgVjjX7Pg8n-kDK962"], "position": 6, "type": "video", "id": "UEwwbG85TU9CZXRFRlg2a1pnVmpqWDdQZzhuLWtESzk2Mi41MzJCQjBCNDIyRkJDN0VD", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01", "description": "\"Al conversar sobre los 4 poderes:\n El poder del cambio\n El poder de la actitud\n El poder de las emociones\n El poder de las decisiones\n los asistentes a esta charla estar\u00e1n preparados para tomar mejores decisiones en su v\u00eda y en el trabajo\""}, {"url": "RlVqJlj1Nn0", "label": "Latinx in Tech - Roberta Arcoverde, Juli\u00e1n Duque, Felipe de Morais, Alexandra Bourne - Lorena Mesa", "imagen": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RlVqJlj1Nn0/mqdefault.jpg", "playlistId": ["PL0lo9MOBetEFX6kZgVjjX7Pg8n-kDK962"], "position": 7, "type": "video", "id": "UEwwbG85TU9CZXRFRlg2a1pnVmpqWDdQZzhuLWtESzk2Mi5DQUNERDQ2NkIzRUQxNTY1", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01", "description": "Drawing off the rich experiences of our panelists, we will discuss common challenges and opportunities our panelists have encountered in building their careers in tech and what they are hopeful for in the future for Latinx technologists."}, {"url": "ASI5RADcRdk", "label": "Paula Goyanes - The internet is for everyone - how to build for accessibility and inclusion", "imagen": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ASI5RADcRdk/mqdefault.jpg", "playlistId": ["PL0lo9MOBetEFX6kZgVjjX7Pg8n-kDK962"], "position": 8, "type": "video", "id": "UEwwbG85TU9CZXRFRlg2a1pnVmpqWDdQZzhuLWtESzk2Mi5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2", "publishedAt": "2020-10-01", "description": "The internet is for everyone - and your website can be too.

Click on the settings tab and then scroll down on that initial page until you get to the features section here and just click the box for discussions. It's as easy as that and then when you scroll back up you're going to see that there's now a discussions item on your repo.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally discussions are designed to be different from issues so when we think of issues. They're to talk about an issue right so they're generally designed to be somewhat focused we're talking about a specific thing often in association with the work or the code that we're actually working on, and issues often lead to pull requests right so very much about specific aspects of our workflow. Discussions on the other hand are intended to be much more free form much more open and much more wide ranging. For example this might be a way for you to interact with your user community around broader questions like how do i use your tool, what are the pros and cons of your tool, what are the philosophical implications of what you're writing here.\"\n\n\"Now we're going to go on and check out possibly the most exciting the most complex and I think the most far-reaching and impactful of the features that we released at GitHub Universe and that's something called GitHub Codespaces. \n\nNow before I get into that spoiler alert we're going to talk about a demo that we're working on here that really exercises a lot of the other features that we released at universe and that we released since then so if you weren't aware we now support multiple really as many environments as you like. You can have manual gateways so that somebody has to manually approve when code can be deployed to a given environment, and of course you can also specify secrets that are scoped to a specific environment.\" \n\n\"So VS Code what's that doing in there? These look like settings for visual studio (VS) code that i might have on my desktop for my visual studio code fat client. Right? Setting up tasks debug launch profiles and things like that well that's odd normally we don't store that in the repository...\""}, {"url": "RcDePXkRHdw", "label": "Friday Deploy!

Whether you're a hobbyist, an open source maintainer, or an organization, the single truth remains: We can\u2019t buy time. Success is often determined by how efficiently we are using our time. In order to increase our efficiencies, we turned to GitHub Actions to automate our workflows for both the software and hardware we produce. We are now able to reprogram our Arduino board, test the input/output of the hardware, and then send the results back to GitHub Actions. We can completely automate not just a continuous integration of the software but also of the hardware using solely online tools.

Take for example, the Equifax breach, when the private data of more than 143 million people became publicly available due to a security vulnerability in an outdated software dependency. Despite the fact that GitHub Security Alerts and other tools allow software developers to check free open-source dependencies, developers still aren't paying enough attention to their security. In this talk, Ivan will discuss the perceptions of developers coming from 25 companies located in nine countries\u2014and will present the insights on their practices, from the selection of software dependencies and updating of software dependencies to automating the dependency-management process and the mitigation of bugs and vulnerabilities in dependencies where a fixed version doesn't exist.

As enterprises start to scale in multi-cloud environments, the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process is no longer just a developer specific workflow, but a DevOps workflow where both development and operations coordinate their tasks to move forward rapidly. GitHub and HashiCorp are working closely to build an end-to-end DevOps workflow encompassing the entire application development lifecycle. Together we help provide a powerful CI/CD solution that prevents developers and operators from having to wait for their respective tasks to be completed, accelerating delivery.

Did you know that a booklet about innersource is the single most downloaded non-code asset on public GitHub? Since the rise of GitHub Enterprise, companies are increasingly experimenting with innersource inside their firewalls. Seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? Most long-established companies need more collaboration and full-stack knowledge (and fewer information silos, resulting resource bottlenecks, \"not-invented-here\" re-inventions of the wheel, lack of innovation, and all the other un-necessarily wasteful proprietary practices that contribute to poor quality software and low engineering employee morale). Meanwhile, FOSS developers as a rule feel empowered to \"scratch their own itches\" and therefore suffer from few of these proprietary company woes. But as the FOSS movement has grown, there are cracks in sustainability starting to show in the form of maintainer burnout, lack of sufficient or appropriate corporate support for FOSS, and a real shortage of people willing and able to lead FOSS into the future. So how can innersource help FOSS Sustainability? Learn from someone who is thinking about how to grow the pool of qualified FOSS developers and to improve corporate support for FOSS basically since the term open source was coined. You'll hear about specific actions every developer and every company can take to improve software engineering, whether FOSS or proprietary, and help sustain the precious FOSS ecosystem through the next generation.\n\nGitHub Satellite: A community connected by code\n\nOn May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world\u2019s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.\n\nMore information: https://githubsatellite.com\nSchedule: https://githubsatellite.com/schedule/"}, {"url": "XwKTUji5HtY", "label": "Securing the software supply chain together - GitHub Satellite 2020", "imagen": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XwKTUji5HtY/mqdefault.jpg", "playlistId": ["PL0lo9MOBetEH4Ki3DGF19QGOQ6wjcsvva"], "position": 17, "type": "video", "id": "UEwwbG85TU9CZXRFSDRLaTNER0YxOVFHT1E2d2pjc3Z2YS41MjE1MkI0OTQ2QzJGNzNG", "publishedAt": "2020-05-07", "description": "Presented by Maya Kaczorowski, Product Manager, Software Supply Chain Security, GitHub\n\nWriting secure code is hard in its own right, but understanding what vulnerabilities exist in your code\u2014 and how to keep up to date with the latest patches\u2014is daunting for even the most sophisticated software teams.

In fact, mainframe workloads are growing in many Enterprises. Until recently mainframe tooling and development processes have been static - stuck in earlier eras. Non-mainframe developers favor Git and GitHub for their decentralized nature, collaboration, and workflow flexibility. As seasoned mainframe programmers leave the workforce many developers are being hired to enhance, modernize, and manage mainframe applications. This makes the need to provide familiar tools and processes more important than ever.\n\nThis session covers how businesses can modernize their mainframe development experience with tooling including Git, GitHub, and Jenkins, making it easier for a new generation of developers to support growing mainframe workloads.\n\nAbout GitHub Universe:\nGitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

This is an excuse to not write documentation or justify the absence of it. In my work with many teams, the lack of documentation is often a symptom of high technical debt.\n\nWhat if we could turn this around and use documentation like a driver for positive culture change and start paying the critical technical debt? This approach not only helps teams to faster identify areas that need critical support but also brings more empathy to the table.\n\nIn this talk, Tania draws on experiences using documentation as a weapon for positive culture and process change in machine learning and scientific computing environments. She focuses on the processes and approaches that enable the creation of documentation for data scientists, infrastructure, and software engineering teams, and clients.\n\nBy the end of the talk, you'll learn efficient techniques to make documentation a first-class citizen in your development cycles\u2014and leave with one or two tricks to convince even the most reluctant developer to document code.\n\nAbout GitHub Universe:\nGitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

They mustered the patience and the energy to teach Git to yours truly. They did it in stages: they started by how to clone a repository and how to check out its branches, taught me about remotes and how to create my own branches, how to commit my changes, and the etiquette of good commit messages. One glorious day, they decided I was ready to push to a remote repository. By golly I felt powerful. I had mastered Git's mysteries!\n\nBecoming familiar with Git's basic concepts and commands took the best part of 2 years, but it was worth every minute. As a designer, learning Git made me more resilient, more independent and more useful to my development team. Learning Git made me a better designer.\n\nIn this talk, I will try to convince developers that they should invest time and effort in teaching Git to the designers they work with, what they have to gain from it, and how to go about it. \n\nAbout GitMerge\nGit Merge is the pre-eminent Git-focused conference: a full-day offering technical content and user case studies, plus a day of workshops for Git users of all levels.

(Yes.) Not soon after, Microsoft launched an AI chatbot experiment, called Tay, which shut down when the software began spewing hateful speech online. One of the known fears of AI and machine learning is the notion of algorithmic bias, which can create or indirectly allow machines to learn prejudiced behavior. In this talk, we will explore what it really means to \u201cteach\u201d a computer to have prejudices, and what can happen product managers, designers, and engineers are not cognizant of their own biases. Appropriate for both technical and non-technical audiences.

We considered declaring a \u201cgit holiday\u201d for this, but even one day of downtime would have been unacceptable and we needed to be able to roll back quickly if something went wrong.

These are mantras of the tech and design industry. They praise speed and hard work but overlook a core element: people. When building software, we devote hundreds of hours to planning, organizing, building, and launching, but we often only spend a very small fraction of that same time thinking about the people responsible for those activities. Soft skills and emotional intelligence are critical components to building great software. In general, I have found technical audiences do not get as much exposure to these topics as they should. Understanding each other and knowing practical ways to keep each other motivated and encouraged will help us go beyond what our individual technical skills can accomplish. Let's talk about how we can proactively care for our team with the same passion we use when caring for our software. We\u2019ll explore practical ways to change how we engage with each other to help us build a more supportive working environment and also deliver better products, faster.\n\nAbout GitHub Universe:\nGitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

For years, the course relied on homegrown tools to manage students' homework submissions and teaching assistants' grading workflows. The course eventually migrated those tools to the cloud, leveraging IaaS but still reinventing too many wheels. The course has since embraced PaaS, with its server-side tools now Dockerized, and SaaS, with its client-side tools now implemented as abstractions atop GitHub. Via the latter, in particular, have we increased our efficiency and reduced our costs. We present in this session how and why we have leveraged GitHub to support CS50's thousands of students and hundreds of teachers.\n\nAbout GitHub Universe:\nGitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

This is true, but at this level, not very actionable. Over our years of building and deploying tools to development teams, we have found that providing the right tools can act as a catalyst for positive culture change. When you provide the right tools to your development teams at scale, you show that you\u2019re serious about changing the way they work. When you help teams learn and master the modern practices that the tools enable, your teams get better at their craft. Your investment in tools and practices help create an environment that attracts and retains top talent. This is all easier said than done, and in this 40 minute panel discussion Bill Higgins, IBM Distinguished Engineer, along with Jason Warner, SVP of Technology of GitHub, discuss concrete strategies for rolling out great tools at scale, including: choosing the right tools, finding and empowering user champions, enabling effective continuous learning (in the context of doing work), gaining the support of senior leadership. Bill and Jason have many years of experience building and deploying tools, and now work closely together on the evolution of GitHub for Business and using GitHub at IBM.\n\nAbout GitHub Universe:\nGitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

However there are answers about 'local' knowledge (architecture, domain, release procedures, coding practices, etc.) which are not as easily found. These questions and answers are passed as tribal knowledge from developer to developer. We wanted to find a better way to share this information. Our team introduced a learning repository utilizing GitHub and Markdown, using the same workflow and diligence used for writing software in capturing our 'local' knowledge.

This talk from Anjuan Simmons will help you understand that, no matter your background, you have privilege and can lend it to marginalized groups in tech.\n\nPrivilege is access to societal and economic benefits based on a characteristic you possess. The most well understood forms of privilege are the ones most people don't choose for themselves like parental, racial, gendered, and physical privilege. However, there are also selected privileges like religion, gender identity, and education.\n\nThis session will teach attendees how to lend their privilege. They will learn three types of privilege lending including credibility lending (where you attach your name to a project being undertaken by someone without privilege), access lending (where you provide access to a position, location or event), and expertise lending (where you give the opportunity to be recognized as an expert). These different types of privilege lending will be illustrated through well known examples and concrete examples of how they can play out in the technology industry.\n\nAbout GitHub Universe:\nGitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

She has carefully updated her approach over the years based on learner feedback, and adult education best practices. But no matter what enhancements she makes, most people still find Git really freaking hard to learn on their own. In this session you will learn why most approaches to teaching Git fail to appropriately address the adult learner. You will learn how to modify your own approach to teaching Git so that others catch on quicker. Finally, you will explore some of the next steps that might be available to the Git community to help change Git from the inside-out--lowering the bar to entry and making Git a more pleasant experience for everyone who uses it.

To change your infrastructure, you edit those files. Having application and infrastructure code together in a single, robust, versioned repository like Git gives a lot of advantages. Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk you can link your Git branches to different infrastructure environments (e.g. test, production) and automate deployments. You can create test environments on-demand, even for a short time. Instead of continuously update your resources, you can recreate them quickly from scratch, simplifying lifecycle management and making deployments immutable.
